This directory  contains the resources  necessary to build  the WSJT-X
samples database. The CMake build script creates a directory structure
ready for  upload to the project  samples web or ftp  file server. The
CMake  script  also  defines  a build  target  'upload-samples'  which
uploads  the sample  database to  the the  destination defined  by the
project  CMake variable  PROJECT_SAMPLES_UPLOAD_DEST  (defined in  the
project root  CMake script). A  suitably authorized user may  use this
target to update the server with the latest samples.

The  samples  database   includes  a  JSON  contents   file  for  each
major/minor version combination  of WSJT-X, this file  is generated by
CMake and should not be manually edited.

To  add  new  samples  simply  add  the  files  here  and  update  the
SAMPLE_FILES  list  variable  in   the  CMakeLists.txt  file  in  this
directory.  Sample  files  must  be checked  into  source  control.  A
meaningful  directory  structure  is  advisable,  the  same  directory
structure will  be replicated by  the WSJT-X sample  downloader dialog
allowing  WSJT-X  users  to  easily identify  wath  each  sample  file
contains.
