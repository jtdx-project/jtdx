Select the *Audio* tab to configure your sound system.

- _Soundcard_: Select the audio devices to be used for *Input* and
*Output*.  Usually the *Mono* settings will suffice, but in special
cases you can choose *Left*, *Right*, or *Both* stereo channels.

IMPORTANT: If you select the audio output device that is also your
computer's default audio device, be sure to turn off all system sounds
to prevent transmitting them over the air.

IMPORTANT: Be sure that your audio device in configured to sample at
48000 Hz, 16 bits.

- _Save Directory_: _WSJT-X_ can save its received audio sequences as
+.wav+ files.  A default directory for these files is provided; you
can select another location if desired.

- _AzEl Directory_: A file named +azel.dat+ will appear in the
specified directory.  The file contains information usable by another
program for automatic tracking of the Sun or Moon, as well as
calculated Doppler shift for the specified EME path.  The file is
updated once per second.
