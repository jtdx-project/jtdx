_Working Frequencies_: By default the *Working Frequencies* table
contains a list of currently recommended dial frequencies for each
mode.  You can modify the frequency table as desired.

- To change an existing entry, click to select it, type a desired
frequency in MHz, and hit *Enter* on the keyboard. The program will
format your frequency value appropriately and add a band designator.

- To add a new entry, right-click anywhere on the frequency table and
select *Insert*.  Enter a frequency in MHz in the popup box and select
the desired mode (or leave the Mode selection blank).  Then click
*OK*.  The table may include more than one frequency for a given band.

- To delete an entry, right-click it and select *Delete*.

- Click the *Reset* button to return the table to its default
configuration.

_Frequency Calibration_: If you have calibrated your radio using WWV
or other reliable frequency references, or perhaps with the technique
described {fmt_wspr}, enter the measured values for _Intercept_ A and
_Slope_ B in the equation

 Dial error = A + B*f

where "`Dial error`" and A are in Hz, f is frequency in MHz, and B is
in parts per million (ppm).

Frequency values sent to the radio and received from it will
then be adjusted accordingly so that frequencies displayed by _WSJT-X_
are accurate.

_Station Information_: You can save *Band*, *Offset* and *Antenna
Description* information for your station.  The antenna information
will be included in reception reports sent to {pskreporter}.  By
default the frequency offset for each band is zero.  Nonzero offsets
may be added if (for example) a transverter is in use.

- For a simple setup approach you might want to delete any unwanted
bands -- for example, bands where you have no equipment.  Then click
on a *Frequency* entry and type *Ctrl+A* to "`select all,`" and
drag-and-drop the entries onto the _Station Information_ table.  You
can then add any transverter offsets and antenna details.

- To avoid typing the same information many times, you can
drag-and-drop entries between the lines of the _Station Information_
table.

- When all settings have been configured to your liking, click *OK* to
dismiss the *Settings* window.
