// Status=review

Since 2005 the _WSJT_ project (including programs _WSJT_, _MAP65_,
_WSPR_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_) has been "`open source`", with all
code licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL).  Many users of these
programs, too numerous to mention here individually, have contributed
suggestions and advice that have greatly aided the development of
_WSJT_ and its sister programs.

For _WSJT-X_ in particular, we acknowledge contributions from *AC6SL,
AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, K9AN, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KB1ZMX, KD6EKQ,
KI7MT, KK1D, ND0B, PY2SDR, VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, W4TI, W4TV, and W9MDB*.
Each of these amateurs has helped to bring the program’s design, code,
and documentation to its present state.

Most of the color palettes for the _WSJT-X_ waterfall were copied from
the excellent, well documented, open-source program _fldigi_, by *W1HKJ*
and friends.

We use development tools and libraries from many sources.  We
particularly wish to acknowledge importance of the GNU Compiler
Collection from the Free Software Foundation, the "clang" compiler
from LLVM at the University of Illinois, and the Qt Project from Digia
PLC.  Other important resources include the FFTW library by Matteo
Frigo and Steven G. Johnson; SLALIB, the Positional Astronomy Library
by P. T.  Wallace; and a high-precision planetary ephemeris and
associated software from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
