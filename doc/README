This folder  contains the sources  of WSJT-X documentation.   To build
these you will need the asciidoctor tool installed.

If you do not wish to build  the documentation, it is possible to skip
this  directory  in the  WSJT-X  build  by  setting the  CMake  option
WSJT_GENERATE_DOCS to OFF in your build tree.


On Linux
========

You will probably have these installed already if you are building the
WSJT-X  manpages,  if you  are  not  you  will  just need  to  install
asciidoc:

 sudo apt-get install asciidoctor

or

 sudo yum install asciidoctor

or whatever your distribution and package management requires.


On Mac OS X
===========

I recommend MacPorts:

 sudo port install rb-rubygems
 sudo gem install asciidoctor


On Windows
==========

The asciidoctor  tool is a  Ruby script so you  will need to  install a
version of Ruby. The gem tool is a good way to install asciidoctor:

   gem install asciidoctor
