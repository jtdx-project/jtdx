Forcing QT5 style to STYLE.
STYLE can be Fusion (default) or Windows.


*-r, --rig-name*[=RIGNAME]::

Enable multiple instances of the jtdx(1) application to run
concurrently.  Each RIGNAME must be unique. One instance may use no
RIGNAME. If this option is not supplied then only one instance of
jtdx(1) may be run at any time.


*-v, --version*:: Display the application version.

*-h,--help*:: Display usage information.

*--test-mode*::

When this option is provided all writable files will be placed in a
special test location (~/.qttest).  This option is only for
application testing and is not designed for normal operations.  **Use
with caution**.

== FILES

Most of the following files are in a directory path containing the
directory name *JTDX[ - RIGNAME]* which indicates the value of the
command line option *--rig-name=RIGNAME* to indicate multiple instances of
*jtdx* running concurrently. All writable files listed below are
therefore unique to each concurrent instance of *jtdx*. If the
*--rig-name* command line option is not supplied or the *RIGNAME* argument
is not supplied then the directory paths below will have the directory
*JTDX*.

~/.config/JTDX[ - RIGNAME].ini::

This file stores the application
configuration settings.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/cty.dat::

This file is not required as a version of it is embedded in the
