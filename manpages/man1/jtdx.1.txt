JTDX home page:: https://jtdx.tech/en/

JTDX User's Guide:: https://jtdx.tech/en/videos-guides

== OPTIONS

*--style*[=STYLE]::

Forcing QT5 style to STYLE.
STYLE can be Fusion (default) or Windows.


*-r, --rig-name*[=RIGNAME]::

Enable multiple instances of the jtdx(1) application to run
concurrently.  Each RIGNAME must be unique. One instance may use no
RIGNAME. If this option is not supplied then only one instance of
jtdx(1) may be run at any time.


*-v, --version*:: Display the application version.

*-h,--help*:: Display usage information.

*--test-mode*::

When this option is provided all writable files will be placed in a
special test location (~/.qttest).  This option is only for
application testing and is not designed for normal operations.  **Use
with caution**.

== FILES

Most of the following files are in a directory path containing the
directory name *JTDX[ - RIGNAME]* which indicates the value of the
command line option *--rig-name=RIGNAME* to indicate multiple instances of
*jtdx* running concurrently. All writable files listed below are
therefore unique to each concurrent instance of *jtdx*. If the
*--rig-name* command line option is not supplied or the *RIGNAME* argument
is not supplied then the directory paths below will have the directory
*JTDX*.

~/.config/JTDX[ - RIGNAME].ini::

This file stores the application
configuration settings.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/yyyymm_ALL.txt::

*ALL.txt* contains a record of transmitted and received messages and
other activity such as frequency or band changes.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/save/::

Is the default location for saved .WAV files recorded by the
application.  The .WAV file save location may be changed in the
applications settings dialog.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/save/samples/::

Sample .WAV files supplied with the application are found in this
directory, they may be played back in the application and are referred
to in the user guide tutorial sections.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/cty.dat::

This file is not required as a version of it is embedded in the
application, but if you wish an updated version can be placed here.
If present that version will be used in preference to the embedded
version.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/wsjtx.log::

This is a plain text CSV record of logged QSOs.

~/.local/share/JTDX[ - RIGNAME]/wsjtx_log.adi::
