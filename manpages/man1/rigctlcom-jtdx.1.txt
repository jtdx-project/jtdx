== NAME

rigctlcom-jtdx - Hamlib 4 rigctlcom Serial port passthru Kenwood TS-2000 emulator.

== SYNOPSIS

*rigctlcom-jtdx* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

*wsjtx* uses a version of the *hamlib* CAT control library.  This
 library is virtually identical to the current release version of
 *hamlib*. If a *wsjtx* user wishes to use the *hamlib* TS-2000
 emulator *rigctlcom* to allow CAT applications that do not talk to
 *hamlib* to share CAT control control their transceiver; then this
 special version of *rigctlcom* should be used since that too has the
 modified *hamlib* code embedded with it.
