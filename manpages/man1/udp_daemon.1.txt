== NAME

udp_daemon - Reference example UDP server

== SYNOPSIS

*udp_daemon* ['OPTIONS']

== DESCRIPTION

*udp_daemon*  does  not  serve  any   useful  purpose  other  than  to
 demonstrate  the UDP  message features  of  *JTDX*. It  is a  small
 command  line application  that interacts  with any  running *JTDX*
 instances.

Developers writing  add on  applications may find  the source  code of
*udp_daemon*  contained in  the *JTDX*  code repository  useful. The
files  NetworkMessage.hpp,  MessageServer.hpp,  MessageClient.hpp  and
their  associated implementations  along with  the application  source
UDPDaemon.cpp should cover all the required areas. All these files can
be found at:

https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/HEAD/tree/branches/wsjtx/

*udp_daemon* may also be used as  a multi-cast UDP server which allows
multiple instances of *udp_daemon* to  be run concurrently, to do this
simply pass a suitable multi-cast group address using the command line
option and in *JTDX* in the "*Settings->Reporting->UDP Server*" pane
e.g. 239.255.0.1 or ff03::1 for a local scope group.

Note  that  on some  systems  it  may be  necessary  to  add a  static
multi-cast route to the routing table before multi-cast traffic can be
routed to sockets on the same host as the sender.
