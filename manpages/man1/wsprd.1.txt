== NAME

wsprd - is a decoder for K1JT's Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.

== SYNOPSIS

*wsprd* ['OPTIONS']

== DESCRIPTION

*wsprd* - The program is written in C and is a command-line program that reads
from a .c2 file or .wav file and writes output to the console. It is used by
WSJT-X for wspr-mode decoding. 


== OPTIONS
*-a <path>*:: Path to writeable data files, default="."

*-c <file>*:: Write .c2 file at the end of the first pass

*-e x*:: x is transceiver dial frequency error in Hz

*-f x*:: x is transceiver dial frequency in MHz

*-H* :: do not use, or update the hash table

*-m* :: decode wspr-15 .wav file

*-q* :: quick mode - does not dig deep for weak signals

*-s* :: single pass mode, no subtraction (same as original wsprd)

*-v* :: verbose mode, shows duplicate decodings

*-w* :: wideband mode - decode signals within {plus}/- 150 Hz of center

*-z x*:: x is fano metric table bias, default is 0.42

The Infile can be either .wav or .c2, for example:

-----
./wsprd -wf 14.0956 140709_2258.wav
-----

*NOTE* for .c2 files, the frequency within the file overrides the command
line value.

== FEATURES
* By default, *wsprd* reports signals that are within {plus}/- 110 Hz of the
subband center frequency. The wideband option (-w) extends this to {plus}/- 150 Hz.

* *wsprd* maintains a hashtable and will decode all three types of wspr
messages. An option (-H) is available to turn off use of the hashtable.

* The symbols are decoded using Phil Karn's sequential decoder routine, fano.c

== NOTES
. This program attempts to maximize the number of successful decodes per transmit
interval by trying to decode virtually every peak in the averaged spectrum. 
The program also implements two-pass decoding, whereby signals that are successfully
decoded are subtracted one-by-one during the first decoding pass. Then, the 
decoder is run again. In many cases the subtraction process will uncover signals
that can then be successfully decoded on the second pass.

. There will be occasional duplicate decodes when two closely spaced 
peaks come from the same signal. The program removes dupes based on callsign 
and frequency. Two decodes that have the same callsign and estimated frequencies
that are within 1 Hz will be treated as decodes of the same signal. This
dupechecking is turned off with the -v flag.
